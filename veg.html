<p >Vegetable in a general and common sense refers to any edible part (root, leaves, stem, flowers, seeds, bulbs, fruit) of herbaceous plants consumed as food by humans, as well as to the plant itself that is cultivated for an edible part. However, vegetable is a culinary term more so than one of scientific classification, and its use is somewhat arbitrary and subjective. Though the exceptions are many, in general, vegetables are thought of as being savory and not sweet.
